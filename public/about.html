<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    I am Alexi Zaránd, a resident of Budapest, who studies at the NIK faculty of Óbuda University.
    I am a sociable, friendly people who always likes to communicate with others and meet new people whom I can help or teach them about what they don't understand.

</p>

<p>
    During my studies, the subjects I was most interested in were databases, network systems, and operating systems.
    I have always liked those subjects where group work played a prominent role, where a project had to be implemented in that particular semester.
    I always tried to prepare in advance so that I could only practice the knowledge I had acquired in class, which I would have to use later in tests.
</p>

<p>
    In my private life, entertainment has always played a prominent role, because without I can't relax on weekdays.
    I play a lot of video games and listen to music, podcasts and swim for relaxation, which always helps me to regenerate.
    Whatever hobby is, I'll try it at least once if I am interested, because I never know if it won't help me in life somewhere.
